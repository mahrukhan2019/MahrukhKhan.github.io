      I have gotten my degree of Bachelor of Arts from
      University of Texas at Dallas in Interdisciplinary Studies,
      where I basically got a degree combining Computer Science
      and Information Technology. There I learned coding language
       C++ and Java. I also learned how to incorporate technology with
        businesses. But my passion resides in the
      software engineering side of things.

<br/>
In my spare time I enjoy learning new languages and watching youtube.
Ever since I had laid my hands at coding I have enjoyed this
 with passion. I didn't realize when it went from a hobby to
 something I actually would want to pursue. Originally my major
like many others was pre-med or pre-pharmacy. But after giving
computer science a chance I have deeply enjoyed this.
